# to-do-list-webapp
A To-Do-List App or website done using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

In this web application, a number of tasks can be added (here 3) and can be marked as complete or incomplete. New tasks are added on the input box and on clicking the "Add" button, the new task is added on the list. Completed tasks can be marked on the list and a cross icon is also provided for removal of tasks from the list.

In this JavaScript project a local storage is used, which stores the task list/ To-Do-List in the web browser, so that if the web browser is closed or restarted it will display the list saved in the browser.
